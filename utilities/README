google scholar into another csv with additional info about
Insitutional Research Groups, Insitutional authors,

Donwload newcitations.csv and upload to google docs with conversion set on. 
Copy and paste in Articulos.

From now on, it could be enough to export the articles form google scholar only for the last year,
only the new citations will be updated.

The last update log is in newcitationslog_2016_01.py
